      <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>Designing a website based on a grid, the most popular format being 12 columns and however many rows deemed necessary. It simplifies working with elements.</p>

      <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p>So your website doesn't look like rubbish on a smartphone! Or any device really. You can't be proud of your pretty website if it turns out a hideous mess for 50% of viewers.</p>

      <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
      <p>Using tags logically in accordance to the way they were designed to be used. For example, use tag h1 as the biggest headline text on the page. Don't repurpose it via CSS to be used as a substitute for the p tag, and then redesign h4 as the biggest headline.</p>

      <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
      <p>Turns out placeholder kittens doesn't work perfectly! Helpful tip: instead of using a round number for the resolution, end with a random number and it will work. For example instead of http://placekitten.com/200/300 try http://placekitten.com/201/302</p>
