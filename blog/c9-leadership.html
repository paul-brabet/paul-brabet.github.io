      <h2>Leadership</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership</dt>
        <dd>Perhaps the best example of leadership that I can think of arose in a stressful workplace. There were always unachievable targets, people were pulling unnecessary extra hours that they weren't being paid for, and changes were being made that people did not agree with. We had a relatively new manager in place (we'll call him John). There was competition for the position, and so there was some simmering jealousy or resentment amongst some of the staff. Despite this, John's open and empathetic personality meant that he was an especially effective manager. By effective, I mean people were happier than I had ever seen them in spite of the problems they faced. A lot of managers try to 'tow the line' and try not to show weakness when delivering bad news. In a misplaced attempt at empathy, they feel the hurt before they deliver the news, then shield themselves emotionally when delivering the news. They end up stone walling, cutting them emotionally from the staff.</dd>
        <dt>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</dt>
        <dd>The multiplying goodness meditation worked pretty much as described in the book. It was a little tricky at first to just imagine pulling enough 'goodness' out of thin air, so I decided to focus on goodness coming from other people and their behaviours. To help with this I tied I considered both 'goodness' and 'good vibes'. Lo and behold, focusing on goodness emanating from other people was the next prescribed step!</dd>
        <dd>By the end of the exercise there were two things that I noted. The first is quite simple; I had taken the time to bring my attention to how good people are being to me. It gave me the opportunity to appreciate that. The second is that I wanted to do my own good deeds. Maybe not going out to rescue the world's poor in war torn countries, I might have to do this exercise for a long time before I get that far! But I did want to do little things - be a warmer, more welcoming, and helpful person.</dd>
        <dt>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</dt>
        <dd>I happened to do this last of all the exercies (i.e. after the difficut conversation) so I'll put a blurb there.</dd>
        <dt>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</dt>
        <dd>Lets get the definition out of the way. SCARF stands for the 5 main motivators - Status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness, fairness.</dd>
        <dd>Autonomy has been a big factor in Phase 0 given that it was essentially self taught. In retrospect, I think I started off a little worried; if there wasn't a big stick waiting for me if I didn't complete the work, would I complete the work. That didn't turn out to be a problem. Autonomy really lessened the stress I had to endure; being able to do which tasks I wanted, when I wanted, and in a method that worked for me. Having less stress meant meant I had more for dealing with the tasks at hand, and there was less disincentive for me to continue with the course when things got tough. Status played a role - I wanted to keep up with every other active person in my cohort. Certainty played its part because the uncertainty of not finishing the course is undesirable. Relatedness is a bit tricky, because there wasn't much interaction until my last two and a half weeks when I started coming in regularly. Fairness...I'm not sure how that came into the equation. I guess it is an everpresent motivator against taking a 'cheap' approach to my challenges - if everyone else is doing the hard yards to complete tasks, its only fair that I do the same.</dd>
        <dt>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</dt>
        <dd>It was rough. There were some difficult questions to answer there. In some way a guess its nice to think about the situation from everyone else's perspective, because they would have let this go. To be fair, I think they did very quickly afterwards. I'm not sure how much it has helped though. It just brought up a tough memory to deal with.</dd>
        <dt>So how did Tonglen meditation go?</dt>
        <dd>It went well, I think. It did introduce positive feelings when I was previously feeling a bit down. It also made me feel positive towards others. Again, I'm not going to be saving the world today, but I'm feeling more inclined to be a nicer person.</dd>
        <dt>Any other musings?</dt>
        <dd>Not this week.</dd>
