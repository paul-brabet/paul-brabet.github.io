      <h2>Problem solving</h2>
      <p>27 March 2017</p>
    </div>
    <div class="blogentry">
      <dl>
        <dt>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you: (1) Got blocked on a simple problem, and (2) Solved a problem in an elegant way. What was the problem? What problem solving techniques did you use? How did you feel throughout the process? What did you learn?</dt>
        <dd><b>The simple problem:</b> At one point I couldn't figure out what was wrong with my code. I poured over it - I seemed to have the right type of JS code. The challenge practically asked me to just repeat the same code over and insert one or  two different elements. What was wrong?</dd>
        <dd>So, my first method of problem solving (comparing, and copy pasting similar code) I had already tried, to no avail. Alright, maybe I ought to try something and play with what I've written a little? Just deactivate this code here with the ol' /* */ and do a little experimentation...nope, this isn't working.</dd>
        <dd>Oh hey a small typo! Yes, maybe that's the problem. Nope, but at least this other thing works now.</dd>
        <dd>Next step: chrome's developer tools. It pointed me to a specific line in my JS code and gave an error message, but don't know what is wrong.</dd>
        <dd>Let me think about this. It's probably to do with this variable because the Chrome dev tools doesn't seem to like it. Is there anything experimental about it? Something I haven't written before? Well I haven't had to treat a getElementsByClassName like an array before, how about I just move the [0] outside those inside brackets? No? How about ... EUREKA! Everything works beautifully now!</dd>
        <dd>Was I frustrated? Not quite. I was very determined. I think the best way to put it was that I felt like the solution was on the tip of my tongue. I was also forgiving of myself because it was the final weekly challenge and so I expected it to be the most tricky.</dd>
        <dd>What did I learn? Where to place a [0] when trying to retrieve a specific div via javascript. Also, while writing this I learnt to doubt myself less: I should check the small things first before doubting the overall logic of my code.
        <dd><b>A problem solved in an elegant way:</b> I'm not sure what examples I can draw on that I would eagerly promote as 'elegant'. I think most of the challenge results followed 'DRY' (i.e. don't repeat yourself) and had tidy, working solutions. I managed to smash code out for FizzBuzz like it was nothing though. Every piece worked first time. That felt pretty amazing.</dd>

        <dt>Reflect on how confident you feel using problem solving techniques and process</dt>
        <dd><b>Pseudocode:</b> I like pseudocoding, but I don't use it often enough. At the time of writing, I have decided that my goal is to use pseudocode more often</dd>
        <dd><b>Trying something:</b> I think this is my default way of problem solving.</dd>
        <dd><b>Rubber ducky method:</b> I like the idea. In past jobs I found myself asking senior colleagues for advice, and discover the solution myself before I have finished explaining the problem to them. But for whatever reason I never use the rubber ducky method. It doesn't feel natural to talk to an inanimate object, and so it never happens during my problem solving process. Perhaps I should just put up a picture of myself, and then have a monologue.</dd>
        <dd><b>Reading error messages:</b> As I write more and more code, the more familiar I become with error messages and what kinds of potential solutions there are. I am beginning to think error messages are going to be incredibly helpful.</dd>
        <dd><b>Console.logging:</b> Haven't used it once. I should probably give it a go because I can see it being helpful in a few situations.</dd>
        <dd><b>Googling:</b> I always google for solutions. Aside from playing with code, I would say that googling is my second most used problem solver.</dd>
        <dd><b>Asking your peers for help:</b> Not very confident. I think part of it is that I haven't really met anyone in person yet.</dd>
        <dd><b>Asking coaches for help:</b> I don't think I have ever felt I had a block significant enough to warrant asking a coach. Most of the big problems I have had so far have just been getting through Codeacademy tutorials.</dd>
        <dd><b>Improving your process with reflection:</b> This is something I definitely need to remind myself to do more often.</dd>
        <dt>Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</dt>
        <dd><b>.map()</b> It allows you to call an array and change it based on given criteria.</dd>
        <dd><b>.filter()</b> Removes items from an array depending on given criteria.</dd>
        <dd><b>.reduce()</b> Simplify an array into a single value.</dd>
      </dl>
