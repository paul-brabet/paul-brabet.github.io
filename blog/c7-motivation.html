      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>9 April 2017</p>

    <div class="blogentry">
      <p>Before I start this question answer blog, I just want to say that 'motivation' can be misleading as a title. What usually comes to my mind when I think of the word motivation is the proverbial carrot and stick. Do x for the reward carrot because you want it, or suffer the punishment of the stick. I get the feeling that this kind of thinking is what 'Search inside yourself' is trying to avoid. What is important, I think, is to identify your core values and goals and then align yourself or embody them. Do that then your motivation is already with you. It has been there all along, you just need to uncover it.</p>

        <dt>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</dt>
        <dd>I'm not clear on the question. My life specifically or life in general? I'll answer it with the latter in mind. Reading chapter 7 of 'Search inside yourself' defines pleasure as happiness in the form of a fleeting 'high', passion as happiness from a state of mind when peak performance meets peak engagement, and purpose as an enduring happiness from being part of a larger goal or purpose that has meaning to you.</dd>
        <dt>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</dt>
        <dd><b>What are your core values?</b> Curiosity, creativity, creation, open mindedness, empathy, social inclusion.</dd>
        <dd><b>What do you stand for?</b> I feel like the core values and what I stand for are the same. Throw in liberty, equality, fraternity, because I think those are improtant too.</dd>
        <dd><b>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</b> I thought that paying attention to physical feelings was an interesting way of breaking down distress or joy that allowed me to step back from said feelings. Doing the same without the breakdown makes it harder to distance oneself from the emotions being experienced.</dd>
        <dd><b>Any other musings?</b> I thought it would be good to record the approach to managing negativity. It can be achieved by (1) reminding yourself of your successes - sometimes we find it all too easy to focus on the failures and ignore the successes, (2) bring mindfulness to body, emotional experience, and thoughts, and (3) transform - accept credit and learn from successes, and if experiencing failure then focus on real evidence that it is a temporary setback to balance out negativity.</dd>
