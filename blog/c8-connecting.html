        <dt>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</dt>
        <dd>Not since reading the chapter. This hasn't been for lack of interest in the topic, but rather that the method is for coaching or mentoring. I am not really in a position at the moment to apply this. I can think of prior work situations where this method was employed though, and of the times that it was used by managers I feel like there was definitely a solid level of trust there. Whether the trust was a result of the techniques being used, or the trust allowed for effective discussion in the first place is something I am not sure about.</dd>
        <dt>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</dt>
        <dd>Any willing participants? I don't have anyone available at the moment for this. As a (poor) placeholder, I do have commentary on using the word 'feel' as a tool in discussion because I already use it quite a lot. I have found that it can be very effective in getting to the nub of a person's concern and getting them to really lay things out openly. If I say 'So are you feeling unhappy/excited/whatever?' and I am wrong, they will likely explain their feelings clearly and without the hesitation that people normally have. In some uncommon cases it isn't effective though, because people clam up, or say they don't have any particular emotions to express.</dd>
        <dt>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</dt>
        <dd>I was actually a little overwhelmed! The person I used as a focus is not in a very good state, so there was a flurry of different emotions that I felt that I was hit with.</dd>
        <dt>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</dt>
        <dd>A client was unhappy that I had asked him to provide additional documents. This was at least the second time he had been asked for more information. He only complied because he wanted the entire process over with.</dd>
        <dd>Perspective written from my angle as if 100% correct: I simply did not have the right documentation in order to complete this applicant's request, and in order to finish everything for him, I need the required items.</dd>
        <dd>Perspective written from the other person's angle as if 100% correct: Why could the organisation not have asked me for everything in the first instance? Or perhaps made it really clear at the outset before I sent everything? Why are they asking at all? This seems rather unnecessary.</dd>
        <dt>Any other musings?</dt>
        <dd>I found this chapter's exercises difficult to complete. I don't really have an easy access person with which to try some of these techniques on. However I am keen to try them out once I have a willing participant. I also have few examples of conflict that I can draw on. 'What is this saintly life that Paul lives? How can a person live without conflict?' I hear you ask, and it's a valid question. Maybe I do have conflicts, but just not notice them? I am quite wary of this possibility. On the other hand, maybe I am just forgetful?</dd>
        <dd> As it stands, I genuinely belive that I already have good empathy habits that prevents conflicts becoming a problem, and I am also difficult to anger.</dd>
