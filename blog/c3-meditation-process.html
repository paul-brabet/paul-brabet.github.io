        <dt>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</dt>
        <dd>I decided at a certain point that I could not update the entire website in the time that I had, so I decided to just complete the tasks given. I had learnt enough for the time being.</dd>
        <dt>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</dt>
        <dd>Reading about evidence on the benefits on meditation only confirms my experiences that I have had with it. However it is entirely another to form a habit of doing it. That's what I really need to do.</dd>
        <dt>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</dt>
        <dd>That the benefits extend beyond mental well being and an ability to focus, but meditation appears to also benefit memory retention and even the immune system. I do feel some caution about believing this straight off the bat because only isolated studies appear to have been cited, but I accept the idea that there will be some sort of cognitive or health benefit in meditation.</dd>
        <dt>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</dt>
        <dd>Focusing on breath strikes me as a vital component. If I ever forget my place during meditation, or do not know what to do, I can always bring myself back to breathing.</dd>
        <dt>Any other musings?<dt>
        <dd>Just thinking that if I want to try my utmost to avoid sickness this year, I might as well consider meditation as one experimental tool.</dd>
