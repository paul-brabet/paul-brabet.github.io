      <dl>
        <dt>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</dt>
        <dd>A responsive site adjusts itself to the medium it is viewed on. Since we view websites on many different sizes of screen, and we may be using different inputs like a mouse or thumb, it is important that websites adjust to make themselves fit for purpose.</dd>
        <dt>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</dt>
        <dd>Mobile first design is a method where you begin with a design for smartphones, and then work your way 'up' to large desktops. This approach is important because viewing websites from a device like a smartphone comes with limitations -  bandwidth, processing power, and screen space - that leads to simpler code. You can then specify for desktops additional code. This is more efficient for devices to process than working in the reverse; the reverse being to tell the computer to process a list of code, and then saying at the end "But if you're a small device then cancel all the things I just told you to do."</dd>
        <dd>There are secondary considerations that make an emphasis on mobile first design important. Web designers work from desktops, so if they start from a desktop perspective they may neglect the smartphone perspective. Websites are also being increasingly viewed via smartphone as the smartphones are becoming incrasingly price accessible and powerful, along with the data technology to back them. However, these reasons are more an incentive to take on mobile first design. The "Work your way up" explanation states that mobile first design is the most efficient way to code with little to no cost to the coder.</dd>
       <dt>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</dt>
       <dd>Frameworks are packages of CSS code that have styles already written in, including responsive column based design. This means you do not need to spend a lot of time writing CSS code to achieve the same result, which can be tricky when you consider that you might end up writing fragile CSS code that will play up. Frameworks often produce pleasing and consistent results, and are at the same time a useful shortcut. You can then write your own CSS files to style your site on top of the framework.</dd>
      <dd>There are downsides to using a framework. You might end up with a website that looks generic and you haven't taken full control over making your site. Even if the website looks generic, at least it will be a clean and consistent website. A second downside is that you aren't learning how to code CSS yourself by writing it, but you can always look into the framework and learn from it.</dd>
      <dt>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</dt>
      <dd>A wireframe is a sketch of how a website will look, while keeping in mind the boxes your website elements will make. You will likely organise this to a 12 column model for desktops and a collapsed model for smartphones. It doesn't need to be detailed; just as long as you know what elements to position and where. This gives us a good idea of how to write HTML and CSS code from the outset.</dd>
      <dd>You can see my index and blog page wireframes below. You might notice some elements are missing or have changed. While in the process of writing the code up, I decided some elements were best resized or omitted (such as the picture to accompany the blog title). However, the general layout remains the same.</dd>

      <dt>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</dt>
      <dd>Containing the blog link images to their own 4 column div! They're a little unruly because they want to exceed their own space. Turns out a div inside a div is the solution.</dd>
