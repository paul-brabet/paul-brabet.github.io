    <h1>Phase 0 begins</h1>
    <h3>21 February 2017</h3>

    <p>
      It has only been two days since phase 0 started, so I feel there is much more for me to find out about the EDA experience. So far the approach to education doesn't appear to be conventional. Even though I went into this knowing it was going to be a little different, sometimes I'm surprised by how the course works.

      The fact that my expectations are sometimes upended isn't what matters to me. What matters to me is that I learn and continue to be motivated to do so. I'm feeling quite motivated towards and excited about absorbing as much as I can and driving my own learning right now. By my own definition things are going quite well.

      It was interesting to hear the analogy made by Shareef in his video. He compared most people's expectations of going to a educational instute with a restaurant, versus his approach to the EDA style as being like a hired kitchen. In the latter scenario, rather than being entitled to a service to be fed to the student, the student is part of a group of people who are 'in it together'. A further extension of the analogy Shareef used for the varying levels of experience between individuals; some cooks hold a wealth of experience, and some have never held a knife before, but they all get stuck in to complete their tasks at hand, and assist one another where needed.

      It was comforting to hear this comparison made. While I know there isn't a formal exam, hearing the analogy gave me a different picture where I don't have to stress about how I might be graded or perceived. It allows me to focus on learning and making things I am proud of. And who can deny that an approach to assessment that sounds both holistic <em>and</em> practical (in terms of gaining work skills) sounds ideal?

      At the same time it emphasses the onus on me to take ownership of my own learning and what I produce, which in its own way is a little intimidating. Sometimes I worry about what I'm doing because I'm told to do something, and not given strict instructions on how to do it. Did I upload the right thing to github or have I screwed things up? Have I just embarrassed myself in front of the whole cohort? But then the worry subsides once I tick the task off in waffle and pass the ticket into the review pile. Its done. Rationality returns - 'I'll worry when I have a real reason to' - and I get into the next thing.
