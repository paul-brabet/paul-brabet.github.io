      <h3>what's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
      <p>It has only been two days since phase 0 started, so I feel there is much more for me to find out about the EDA experience. So far the approach to education doesn't appear to be conventional, and that's something I'm both excited and nervous about.</p>

      <h3>what are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>My excitement comes from the amount of freedom I'm given - I am currently quite motivated, and feel that I can do what I want in terms of projects and learning so long as they the tasks are done. My anxiety comes from worrying about ruining things and embarrassing myself. I've been given a playbox that I don't always know how to use. I've panicked a few times about ruining the communal Github repo!</p>

      <p>I also wonder what will happen if my motivation falters.</p>

      <h3>how do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>I think I'll integrate well. I consider myself a social person, and I'm currently motivated.</p>

      <h3>have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p>Yes, its a little more free form than I thought.</p>

      <h3>are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p>I think I covered off this point earlier :)</p>
