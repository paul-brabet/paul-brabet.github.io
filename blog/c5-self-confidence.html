        <dt>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</dt>
        <dd>Mindfulness trains your ability to observe your own thoughts so you do not immediately react to them. Self awareness is being aware of your own emotions. Taking mindfulness practice to observe your emotions so you are removed from them, is the same as being self aware. </dd>
        <dt>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</dt>
        <dd>I already practise the body scan in my mindfulness sessions, so I thought it would be more intresting to try out journaling and document that. This involved two minutes of non-stop stream of thought writing on each of the following topics: "Things that give me pleasure are..", "My strengths are...", "Things that annoy me are...", and "My weaknesses are...".</dd>
        <dd>When I finished reading it, I just thought 'Man, this guy is really harsh on himself and needs to accept his flaws.' Everyone has flaws, and these flaws aren't terrible ones either!</dd>
        <dt>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section</dt>
        <dd>I guess it is one thing to talk about the idea. I read it and agreed with it, but felt like I didn't learn much. I feel like I always have been able to distance my self from my emotions. It's entirely another thing when you do a journal practise and unearth emotions that you always kind of knew were there but ignored. Once you identify such emotions, only then can you separate it out from you.</dd>
