      <h3>create a list of design and structural features you liked that you may want to use in your designs next week</h3>
      <p>Though pretty, I thought the Zen Garden examples weren't very contemporary. So instead I looked around at other websites and liked the following effects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear use of Bootstrap 12 column format, e.g. using 1, 3, and 4 columns.</li>
        <li>Semi flat design, which includes subtle shadows.</li>
        <li>Bold colours (although I would have to redo a lot of my website to incorporate this).</li>
        <li>Text over pictures with a shaded background</li>
        <li>A card-like design to blog post links.</li>
        <li>Blog posts that float up a little with a mouse-over. I think this requires javascript.</li>
        <li>Tinder-like 'swiping' on cards. The action of swiping things is just fun.</li>
        <li>The fragments effect where pieces of a pictured are scattered outside its box. It looks very 90's. Not sure if it will be thematically consistent with my website.</li>
        <li>Overall minimalist looks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
      <p>HTML files are like the blueprints for the structure of a house. CSS files are the instructions for the decoration, like the colour of paint and where furniture might be placed. The DOM is like the brain of a robot builder interpreting these instructions - if you look into it you should see instructions identical to your instructions laid out in the HTML and CSS (except where the robot has found a small error like a typo and generously fixed it). Because this happens in the brain of the robot, changing the instructions in the DOM changes the output without changing the actual written instructions (i.e. the HTML and CSS files are unchanged).</p>

      <h3>what is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
      <p>Simplifying the elements of website or general design into rectangles.</p>

      <h3>what is the box model?</h3>
      <p>A box in a box in a box in a box model that is the content, padding, border, and margin of an HTML element.</p>
