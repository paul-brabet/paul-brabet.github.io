      <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
      <p>That I have much to learn about strengthening my emotional intelligence. I had always thought myself to be quite strong in this area, until it cited self confidence and focus as outcomes of high emotional intelligence.</p>

      <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>Too short! Let me do 10 minutes! I always have two minutes to spare though, so its something I can bust out easily.</p>
