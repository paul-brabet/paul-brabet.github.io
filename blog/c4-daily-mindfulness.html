        <dt>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</dt>
        <dd>It's something I unknowingly practiced with my father quite a lot. He's an old fellow, so he rambles a bit like Abe Simpson. The stories tend to spring up unprompted, and without purpose. This makes it hard to keep focused on what he's saying in day to day conversation. I often have to go over what he said just to confirm to myself that I heard him correctly. Sometimes I get what he said wrong, and I feel a little guilty for my lack of attention, but by the end of the conversation he appreciates me confirming the story with him. It shows him that I am making a real effort at listening.</dd>
        <dt>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</dt>
        <dd>I would like to have a meditation buddy, but its a little tricky synching up on a daily basis for meditation, let alone convincing someone to meditate. I'm  not sure how the 'do less than you can' method would work for me. So I'll adopt the 'take one breath a day' method. Not only is it easy to do, but it sounds like a good way of breaking into a proper session. This would help resolve the major problem I have at the moment, which is practising on a regular basis.</dd>
        <dt>Any other musings?</dt>
        <dd>I practised mindful walking; I went out for a walk for more than hour, and maybe 10 minutes were dedicated to mindfulness. It felt different to mindful conversation or mindful sitting because it felt much more mentally 'active'. Keeping my mind on my footsteps and the motion of both feet was tricky (lift, move, place foot) and required substantial effort. This was at a casual pace.</dd>
        <dd>I think in the future I might look at other mindful walking techniques, because what I tried this week was a bit intense.</dd>
        <dd>I feel that this week I have never been more aware that half of mindfulness is training focus, so that it becomes easier for you to focus in everyday life. Training my focus is something my scatterbrain could definitely do with more of!</dd>
