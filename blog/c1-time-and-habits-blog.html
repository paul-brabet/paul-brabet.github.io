    <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </h3>
    <p>
      In all honesty, I haven't had an opportunity to try anything new yet! Though, I have participated in mindfulness before, and I must say that I find it rewarding. It's not something I have a habit of doing regularly, but coincidentally I happened to have a stressful afternoon so I took 10 minutes today to listen to a guide from a mindfulness app.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some other habit techniques that I want to try, which I'll get to in a later question.
    </p>
    <h3>what did you find interesting?</h3>
    <p>
      I've heard about most of these techniques before, but it was interesting to hear an explanation behind it; e.g. giving yourself small rewards isn't necessarily about 'If a finish x I will get reward y' but an unconcious habit that forms as a result.
    </p>
    <h3>what worked for you?</h3>
    <p>
      Before taking 10 minutes for a mindfulness session I was quite irritable and couldn't focus. After the session I was much more calm - like the frustrations had been emptied out of the basket that is my head - and I could focus more easily on the tasks ahead.
    </p>
    <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>
      I should make a habit of mindfuless and meditation, even if I'm already feeling great. I am curious to try out the small steps and small celebrations method. They look easy to implement!
